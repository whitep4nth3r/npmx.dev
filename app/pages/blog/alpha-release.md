# Announcing npmx: a fast, modern browser for the npm registry

Today we're announcing the alpha release of npmx.dev, a fast, modern browser for the npm registry.

npmx is an open-source project stewarded by a rapidly growing community. It's built for open-source developers, and by
extension, everyone who works in the JavaScript ecosystem.

npmx is about speed and simplicity. Our mission is to create tools that make it quicker and easier for package
maintainers to manage their packages, and to provide valuable data insights coupled with power-user features to help
developers discover packages and make informed decisions about the packages they choose to use.

At the heart of npmx is the web development community. To this end, we're also building rich social features into npmx
on top of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), an open, decentralized network for building social applications. We
want to make it easier for developers to connect with each other, share their work, collaborate on projects, and,
ultimately, to build a more vibrant and inclusive web development community through the power of the ecosystem and open
source.

## The need for npmx

On January 22nd 2026, Daniel Roe, open-source maintainer and founder, and leader of the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) core
team, had an idea, and made
[the first commit to the npmx repository](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/commit/e39e56c08fd1e7bdb556c8565c6b11b3c34c8934).
The next day, [Daniel asked on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3md3cmrg56k2r) about people's
frustrations with the current experience on npm experience on the web and the CLI. The question resonated deeply with
the community as they voiced frustrations with the user experience including code browsing, missing data and trust
signals including surfacing dependencies, and the friction surrounding the publishing experience.

It was clear there was a huge opportunity to build a fast, modern browser for the npm registry, and that there were
people willing to work with Daniel to build it.

## The power of community

Enthusiasm travelled quickly through the network about the idea of npmx, and just a day later, it started to become a
reality. In just 24 hours, a growing community had mobilised in the form of contributions to the npmx project, and
opened 49 pull requests in a single day. And this showed no signs of slowing down. Not more than two weeks later, the
[community had contributed 1000 issues and PRs](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/issues/1000) to the project. The
statistics tell a story of one PR or issue every 20 minutes, around the clock, which equated to over a million seconds
of project activity in just two weeks. We don't know the exact statistics, but with ADD_NUMBER_HERE contributors to
date, we hypothesise that this might be the most active open-source project yet.

At npmx, we don't believe this happened by chance. npmx was created to meet the needs of a global and diverse developer
community, prioritising accessibility, internationalization, and decentralization. As a result, a strong and diverse
global community came together to realise this vision. And the great thing about people who believe in these areas of
focus, is that they're all committed to collaborating in meaningful ways whilst building an inclusive and welcoming
environment in which to do so: together. The npmx project is a testament to how open source is a powerful enabler and a
powerful builder of communities when done really, really well.
